# GlazewskiMetrics

GlazewskiMetrics is an advanced analytical college basketball ranking system. All Division 1 Men's College Basketball teams are compared on an equal scale that adjusts for quality of opponent and adjusts important stats, such as eFG% and Offensive Efficiency.

Code for calculating these stats rests in the views.py file.

The website's design is a work in progress, with additional features coming in the future, such as: 

Projected seeding in the NCAA tournament
Player stats
Probabilities of future outcomes on each team's schedule
